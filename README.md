# YDEV

This project is a social media created divided into microsservices and based on a simple RestFul API pattern. It lacks on some optimizations and polishment, but given the project deadline, works pretty well and can handle all types of requests. This project creates users and handles rendering and the storage of a social media for developers.

## This repo
Main ydev repo, working on desktop powered by javaFX, handling the requests to the server (server which is not on prod, you can just test it now by running our other repos [backend](https://github.com/ydev0/ydev_app) and [db](https://github.com/ydev0/ydev_db)
